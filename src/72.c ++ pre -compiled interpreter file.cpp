///// conditions and operation breakpoints. Condition breakpoints can be stopped under a loop of the program. The operation breakpoint can observe the variable value without re -compilation.
//// Typical is the position of the 3D program to test the position of the mouse
//// Safety programming, hope to reduce collapse, memory leakage, illegal access and other issues
//// Pre -compiled interpreter file: Grab a bunch of header files, switch them to the format that can be used by the compiler, without having to read these header files over and over again
//// Function: Receive a bunch of head files you tell it to receive, it only compiles once, stored in a binary format
//// Mainly used for code written by developers, such as C ++ library, standard template library, Windows API
//// VS, once there is a header file, there must be a CPP containing header files. In the settings, the transliteration header is set to create.
