// The function is the code block we write, which is designed to perform specific tasks.These code blocks are called method Method.
//
// Here is the function of the function alone.
//
// Each call function, the compiler generates a call instruction (outside the class, so there is no dynamic binding, and the inner joint will not be considered for the time being).This is basically meaningful. In a running program, in order to call a function, we need to create a stack structure, which means that we must push things like parameters into stacks.We also need a thing called the return address to press into the stack.Then we have to do the different parts of the dual execution files in order to start our functional instructions.
//
// In order to return the results of the push in, then we have to go back until the original call function.It takes time to jump and execute, so it slows down our program.
//
// For the main function, the return value is int, and only the Main function can not RETURN -it will automatically assume that returning 0. (this is a characteristic of modern C and C ++)
